<h1>Hypothes.is API Dashboard</h1>

<h3>Created by Jason Slavin for Lawrence Hanley</h3>

<p>The aim of this project is to create a dashboard which can be used to review and
analyze all annotations from specific URLs. It relies on the Hypothes.is API for
all data relating to annotation.<br>

The hope is that this dashboard once fully realized can provide powerful insights 
into annotations for educational purposes, with the end goal of actually interacting
with annotations through the dashboard to avoid having to keep tabs on student 
annotation throughout multiple urls.</p>
<br>

<h3>Phase 1</h3>
<p> Create data analysis tools utilizing results from hypothes.is API search functionality
for easier visualization. Look into possibilites of interacting with annotations via dashboard
as well.</p>

<h3>Phase 2</h3>
<p>Setting up MongoDB for several purposes, including: user authentication; saving urls,
user preferances,working states; deeper interactions with hypothes.is API, including more
CRUD functioanlity if applicable.</p>

<h3>To Use Dashboard </h3>
<p> Upon opening the page, add a url that has been annotated using hypothes.is. Adding 
additional urls will allow you to view annotations from all multiple urls, which can
then be filtered and sorted.</p>
